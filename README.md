# beeline

A small indie web experience for you and your friends.

## Features

- A very basic post and follow system (micro-blog)
- A very basic pastebin for you alone
- Single file deployment

### TODO

- Add realtime chat area with websockets?
- Add search for pb when logged in to search your own pastes
  - Make sure you can only search your own pastes
- See if we need to include username in cookie?
- Update Readme
- Create new git repo (push to both and setup `both`)
- Update Website with link once this is in better shape
